title: Trying out how to blog!
---

So here I am today trying to create a blog with Jekyll. I think it is rather interesting that creating a blog out of the box has been so easy. Similar to rails, I think the good thing about it is how simple and straightforward creating a simple website to pen your thought has become.

Sites like medium, dev.to and other blogging website also does a similar effect but with this, it has a customized feel to it.

That's pretty much what I would like to share today and also just to see how writing a post is like.
