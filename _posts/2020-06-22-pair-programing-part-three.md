title: Pair Programming Part 3
---

This is the last part of series where I discuss about the benefits of pair-programming.

Today I will be discussing the last key take-away that, to me, is beneficial.

<h3>3. Learning and improving on your social skills</h3>

Besides just coding, the beauty of pair-programming is that it is a very social activity. This makes it at least somewhat fun because we are social creatures afterall. I believe introverts, such as myself, benefit immensely from this because it gives us space to slowly open up to talk and interact. There is no crowd and no one to pressure you. Just your partner and you.
