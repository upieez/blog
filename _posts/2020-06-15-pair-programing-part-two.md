title: Pair Programming Part 2
---

This is a continuation from the previous post aptly named "Pair Programming Part 1".

The second key take-away is the one that I personally feel the most beneficial when it comes to pair programming.

<h3>2. It is a win-win for both</h3>

Being the driver, you get to listen and learn a new topic/skill as the navigator impart his/her knowledge on the topic. Generally, the topic that the navigator is going through will be something that the driver is unfamiliar about. This way, having the curiosity will keep you more engaged and you will become an active listener. However, if the topic is too abstract or challenging, it might lead to a disinterest of pair programming hence to approach this, the navigator has to tread lightly and go at a pace that is manageable so that the driver can ask digest the information and ask the necessary question to understand the overall topic better.

Being the navigator, I will reiterate it again, is that you get to solidify your learning and keep it in your long term memory. Anyone can be a navigator. You do not need to have a deep understanding of a certain topic nor do you need to worry that you might not know what you do not know. A popular saying is:

> If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself

Therefore the best way to actually test if you understood what you have learn is to explain the concept as simply and as concisely as you can to the driver. That way, not only will the driver be able to ask the right question, you will be doing yourself a favor by being able to answer the question that the driver will ask.

I hope this has given you a better insight and hopefully kickstart your journey to practice pair-programming to your peers or to anyone in the programming world.

The next and final take away will be posted soon so keep a look out and watch this space for more!
